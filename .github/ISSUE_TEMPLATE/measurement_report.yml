        ## Superconductivity Measurement Results
        
        🔬 **Critical Submission**: Use this template to report R(T) measurement results on RBT superconductor candidates.
        
        ⚠️ **If you observe R < 10 nΩ at T > 300K, this could be the first room-temperature superconductor discovery!**
        Please provide complete data and be prepared for independent verification requests.

        ## 🚨 Important Notes for Room-Temperature Superconductivity Claims
        
        **If your measurement shows R < 10 nΩ at T > 300K:**
        
        1. **🔒 Secure your data immediately** - backup all files
        2. **📋 Document everything** - detailed protocols, conditions, artifacts
        3. **🔄 Repeat measurements** - multiple devices, multiple operators
        4. **🤝 Seek independent verification** - collaborate with other labs
        5. **📞 Contact theory experts** - verify consistency with RBT predictions
        6. **⚖️ Consider IP protection** - before public disclosure
        7. **📢 Prepare for scrutiny** - extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence
        
        **This could be the discovery that changes the world! 🌍**
