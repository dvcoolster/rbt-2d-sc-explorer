     Program PWSCF v.7.2 starts on 09Jun2025 at 03:13:49
     This program is part of the open-source Quantum ESPRESSO suite

     Parallel version (MPI), running on     1 processors

     Reading input from scf.in

     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  4

     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     a serial algorithm will be used

     Using Slab Decomposition

     bravais-lattice index     =            0
     lattice parameter (alat)  =       6.58350  a.u.
     unit-cell volume          =     784.08  (a.u.)^3

     convergence has been achieved in   10 iterations

!    total energy              =     -123.41452652 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <       0.00000001 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:
     one-electron contribution =     -86.39016857 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      -24.68290530 Ry
