## Getting Started

1. **Fork** the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you're modifying code, ensure you have the dev dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .[dev]
   ```
3. **Open an Issue** or pick an item in `PROJECTS.md` and assign yourself.
4. **Create a WIP pull-request** early so we avoid duplicate work.

## Coding style

* Follow [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and keep functions short.
* Add type hints where it clarifies intent.
* Write docstrings for public functions/classes.

---

## Commit Style

Use conventional commits:

```
feat: short imperative summary
fix:  â€¦
docs: â€¦
chore: â€¦
```

Examples:

```
feat: parity-check CLI v1.0

```

## Tests

* Aim for â‰¥90 % coverage on any new Python file.
