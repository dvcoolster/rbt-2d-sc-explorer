# Strain +0% for BeC3H9

Generated by generate_strain_scan.py

## Files:
- scf.in: Self-consistent field calculation
- ph.in: Phonon calculation with electron-phonon coupling

## Run sequence:
1. pw.x < scf.in > scf.out
2. ph.x < ph.in > ph.out

## Expected strain effects:
- Lattice parameter change: 1.000x
- Expected lambda change: decrease
